      At Mindease, our mission is to help people take control
      of their mental health and wellbeing. We believe that everyone 
      deserves access to tools and resources that can help them 
      manage their emotions, reduce stress, and improve their 
      overall quality of life. That's why we've created an 
      easy-to-use platform that allows users to track their 
      mood, write in their journal, and answer positive checkup 
      questions that can help them identify areas where they 
      might need additional support.

      and software developers who are passionate about making a
